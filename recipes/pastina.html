    <h3>This classic Italian comfort food is super simple to put together</h3>
    <p>Pastina is classic Italian comfort food. It's the kind of dish that a mom might serve her kids when they are feeling under the weather,<br> 
        and is often one of the first solid foods a baby might eat. It's a nostalgic childhood treat in Italy and something your kids are sure to enjoy as well.<br> 
        The preparation of this dish is simple. Small-shaped pasta is cooked with broth until most of the liquid is absorbed. While the mixture is still warm,<br> 
        an egg is immediately stirred into the mixture. I like to add some grated Parmesan cheese along with the egg for added flavor and creaminess.<br> 
        The seasoning is simple: Just a bit of black pepper and maybe a pinch of salt, depending on the saltiness of your broth and cheese.<br>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (1/2 ounce firmly packed freshly grated or 1/3 cup store-bought grated), plus more for garnish.</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, divided</li>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) box dried pastina pasta</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 firmly packed cup), or measure out 1/3 cup store-bought grated.</li>
    <li>Measure 3 cups of the broth into a large saucepan.</li>
    <li>Add 1 (12-ounce) box pastina and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.</li> 
    <li>Continue to cooking, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente and there is a small amount of liquid left in the pan, about 6 minutes. (Add the remaining 1 cup broth a little at a time as needed if you need more liquid.)</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat. Immediately add the Parmesan, 1 large egg, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Quickly stir to incorporate the egg into the warm pasta and melt the cheese. Serve topped with more grated Parmesan or freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
